          <p>The Star Tribune is using weekly Minnesota Secretary of State ballot counts to track early voting trends for this year's midterm election.</p>

          <p>Two years ago, more than 1.3 million absentee ballots were received prior to Election Day. So far, the first week of early voting has surpassed both 2014 at this point, an initial sign of strong midterm turnout in November.</p>

          <p>Here's what to watch for in the numbers.</p>

            <div class="chartTitle">How this year's pace compares to previous elections</div>

            <p>So far, 11,353 <span class="legendary gray5">2018 absentee ballots</span> have been accepted by Minnesota election officials statewide since Sep. 21, in the first of seven early voting weeks before Election Day. This so far outpaces the first week totals for <span class="gray3 legendary">2016</span> and <span class="gray1 legendary">2014</span>.</p>

            <p>Comparing 2018 early ballot totals to those from 2014's midterm shows this year's absentee vote strongly outpacing the last statewide elections by about 200 percent.</p>

            <p>Voter turnout is usually lower in Minnesota midterms than during presidential years, making 2014 more comparable than 2016.</p>

            <div class="chartTitle">Where the early vote is coming from</div>

            <p>Measuring absentee ballots cast by Minnesota county as a percentage of registered voters -- shaded from <span class="legendary gray1">less</span> to <span class="legendary gray5">more</span> -- reveals the most early turnout in Hennepin, Ramsey and Dakota counties.</p>

            <p>Notably, these metro area counties are often heavily Democratic in statewide contests. Additionally, this year Dakota and Hennepin are <a href="http://www.startribune.com/why-you-re-hearing-so-much-about-minnesota-s-congressional-races-this-fall/483225921/">epicenters in two heavily-contested U.S. Congressional races</a> in Districts Two and Three, respectively.</p>

            <p>By comparison, just before Election Day in 2016, counties in northern parts of the state and the Iron Range had the highest percentages of early voter turnout.</p>

            <p>Overall, the majority of <span class="legendary gray5">2018</span> early votes are on pace to come from Hennepin and Ramsey counties, just as they were in <span class="legendary gray3">2016</span>.</p>

            <div class="chartTitle">Whether the youth vote is stronger this year</div>

            <p>Election forecasters are watching this year's youth vote closely since a significant increase in turnout among those aged 18-to-34 <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-youth-could-affect-key-november-elections-if-they-turn-out/480720341/">could strongly impact November's results</a>.</p>

            <p>Comparing the percentage of registered voters by age group casting absentee ballots <span class="legendary gray5">this year</span> compared to <span class="legendary gray3">2016</span> shows a slight boost in the early youth vote.</p>
