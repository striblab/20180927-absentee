          <p>The Star Tribune is using weekly Minnesota Secretary of State ballot counts to track early voting trends for this year's midterm election.</p>

          <p>Two years ago, more than 200,000 absentee ballots were received prior to Election Day. So far, the first week of early voting, which started Sep. 21, has surpassed both the 2014 and 2016 elections at this point, an initial sign of strong midterm turnout in November.</p>

          <p>We'll be tracking the early vote here every week until XXX, with new results typically arriving on Thursdays. Here's what we've learned so far from the numbers.</p>

          <h2 class="chartTitle">So far, more voters are turning out</h2>

          <p>Through nearly two full weeks of early voting, nearly XX,XXX Minnesotans have cast ballots so far this year — XX times the number that had voted early at this point in 2016.</p>

          <p>Being ahead of 2016 is especially significant because midterm turnout is usually much lower in Minnesota than during presidential years.</p>

          <p>High early voting numbers could be a reflection of enthusiasm among voters of both parties. It could also suggest that Minnesotans are getting used to new early voting laws, enacted in 2016, which allow residents to vote absentee without an excuse up to X weeks before the election</p>

          <p>Before 2016, voters who wanted to cast early ballots needed to XYZ.</p>

            <p>Measuring absentee ballots cast by Minnesota county as a percentage of registered voters -- shaded from <span class="legendary gray1">less</span> to <span class="legendary gray5">more</span> -- reveals the most early turnout in Hennepin, Ramsey and Dakota counties.</p>

            <p>Notably, these metro area counties are often heavily Democratic in statewide contests. Additionally, this year Dakota and Hennepin are <a href="http://www.startribune.com/why-you-re-hearing-so-much-about-minnesota-s-congressional-races-this-fall/483225921/">epicenters in two heavily-contested U.S. Congressional races</a> in Districts Two and Three, respectively.</p>

            <p>By comparison, just before Election Day in 2016, counties in northern parts of the state and the Iron Range had the highest percentages of early voter turnout.</p>

            <p>Election forecasters are watching this year's youth vote closely since a significant increase in turnout among those aged 18-to-34 <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-youth-could-affect-key-november-elections-if-they-turn-out/480720341/">could strongly impact November's results</a>.</p>

            <p>Comparing the percentage of registered voters by age group casting absentee ballots <span class="legendary gray5">this year</span> compared to <span class="legendary gray3">2016</span> shows a slight boost in the early youth vote.</p>
