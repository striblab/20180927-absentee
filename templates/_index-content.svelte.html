            <p>The Star Tribune is using weekly Minnesota Secretary of State ballot counts to track early voting trends for this year's midterm election.</p>

            <p>Two years ago, more than 600,000 absentee ballots were received prior to Election Day. So far, the first week of early voting, which started Sep. 21, has surpassed both the 2014 and 2016 elections at this point, an initial sign of strong midterm turnout in November.</p>
  
            <p>We'll be tracking the early vote here every week until Nov. 1, with new results typically arriving on Thursdays. Here's what we've learned so far from the numbers.</p>

        </section>

            <h2 class="chartTitle">So far, more voters are turning out</h2>

            <p>Through nearly two full weeks of early voting, nearly 12,000 Minnesotans have cast <span class="legendary purple3">ballots</span> so far this year — three times the number that had voted early at this point in <span class="gray1 legendary">2014</span> and eight times the <span class="gray3 legendary">2016</span> tally.</p>

            <p>Being ahead of 2016 is especially significant because midterm turnout is usually much lower in Minnesota than during presidential years.</p>

            <p>High early voting numbers could be a reflection of enthusiasm among voters of both parties. It could also suggest that Minnesotans are getting used to new early voting laws, enacted in 2013 and first available in 2014, which allow residents to vote absentee without an excuse up to six weeks before the election.</p>

            <p>Before 2014, voters who wanted to cast early ballots needed to provide an excuse like being outside the state or being otherwise unable to reach a Minnesota polling place.</p>

            <!-- <p>Comparing 2018 early ballot totals to those from 2014's midterm shows this year's absentee vote strongly outpacing the last statewide elections by about 200 percent.</p>

            <p>Voter turnout is usually lower in Minnesota midterms than during presidential years, making 2014 more comparable than 2016.</p> -->

            <p>Measuring absentee ballots cast by Minnesota county as a percentage of registered voters -- shaded from <span class="legendary purple1">less</span> to <span class="legendary purple3">more</span> -- reveals the most early turnout in Hennepin, Ramsey and Dakota counties.</p>

            <p>Notably, these metro area counties are often heavily Democratic in statewide contests. Additionally, this year Dakota and Hennepin are <a href="http://www.startribune.com/why-you-re-hearing-so-much-about-minnesota-s-congressional-races-this-fall/483225921/">epicenters in two heavily-contested U.S. Congressional races</a> in Districts Two and Three, respectively.</p>

            <p>By comparison, just before Election Day in 2016, counties in northern parts of the state and the Iron Range had the highest percentages of early voter turnout.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 class="chartTitle">The metro is outpacing outstate</h2>

            <p>Overall, the majority of <span class="legendary purple3">2018</span> early votes are on pace to come from Hennepin and Ramsey counties, just as they were in <span class="legendary gray3">2016</span>.</p>

            <p>While the Twin Cities has a larger population than other regions of the state, there's also less reason for those living in the cities to file absentee ballots compared to more remote places in Minnesota.</p>

            <h2 class="chartTitle">Keep an eye on the youth vote</h2>

            <p>Election forecasters are watching this year's youth vote closely since a significant increase in turnout among those aged 18-to-34 <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-youth-could-affect-key-november-elections-if-they-turn-out/480720341/">could strongly impact November's results</a>.</p>

            <p>This year's early youth vote comprises XX percent of absentee ballots filed so far. In 2016, voters aged 55 or older had the highest absentee turnout.</p>
